# Task 1: software configuration.
## Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge
#### I want to prove myself that I can do better. After having kids I didn't have a chance to learn something for my IT career. I couldn't afford to pay for courses, I didn't have time to complete the course... I want to change it, it is my goal to finish the course and to do my best in it. And finally I do something for myself (it might sound selfish, but all mothers would understand me ðŸ˜‰)
